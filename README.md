# AWS-Kinesis-Data-Firehose_AWS-Glue-S3-Athena-and-the-AWS-SDK-to-build-a-Data-Lake
A hands-on data lake project for fictional company ShopSphere, inspired by a real-world use case. Built using AWS Kinesis Data Firehose, Glue, S3, Athena, and the AWS SDK to explore cloud-native data pipelines and showcase production-grade data engineering skills

## üõçÔ∏è ShopSphere Data Lake Pipeline (Real-World Use Case)

This hands-on project simulates a real-world data lake solution for **ShopSphere**, a fictional e-commerce company. While the brand is fictional, the use case is based on an actual scenario‚Äîadapted to maintain confidentiality.

The pipeline leverages **AWS Kinesis Data Firehose**, **AWS Glue**, **Amazon S3**, **Amazon Athena**, and the **AWS SDK** to ingest, transform, store, and query data at scale. This repository is designed to deepen understanding of cloud-native data engineering and demonstrate practical skills for building production-grade pipelines.

Whether you're a data engineer, cloud architect, or curious learner, this project offers a realistic blueprint for solving modern data challenges in a secure, scalable way.
